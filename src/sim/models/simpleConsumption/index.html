<h2>Simple Consumption</h2> 
By Russell C. Thomas
</table>

<p>This is a simulation of consumers in a value space, where consumers are located at their ideal points. 
    Each consumer samples products within a fixed radius, and then consumes with probability proportional
    to the distance.

<!-  Note these can't be aref stuff because Java's simple 
     web browser code doesn't know how to handle PDFs etc.
     Just stick to images and HTML files in your links.
